			<p>COVID-19 and the economy are still important today, but now something new has come up: <em>The Great American Winter Storm of February 2021</em>. Not only did America's Heartland experience "Eternal Winter", but the energy grids of Texas and many states/communities were crippled. Even desert city El Paso, TX had power outages. Those systems can be winterized to prevent future outages, but it takes time and money. Instead, individuals/local communities can have Emergency Winter Storm/Power Outage plans. Today, advice on making plans to survive Winter storms/Power outages will be discussed.</p>

			<p>My Family has lived in Southfield, MI for years, giving us experience dealing with Winter temperatures. We had thermal underwear, hot chocolate/soup recipes/ingredients, and we had shovels for clearing the driveway. I looked forward to snow so I could make snowballs, snow forts, snowmen, snow angels, etc. However, there where Wi-Fi problems/power outages. Once, our basement flooded when the snow melted, and cleaning it up took lots of time and money. We could have planned for events like that to reduce the work, and help others out too. This article helps me and you learn about preparation plans.</p>

			<p>In a Michigan Winter, cold weather and Winter storms aren't scary, kids welcome them, and the opportunity for no school. In America's southern, snow-distant regions however, snow storms can be disasterous especially in power outages. Here is some advise from my own experience:</p>
			
			<ol> 
				<li>Wear Thermal Underwear. Get about 8 for the top and 8 for the bottom. Wear them outside, inside to conserve energy from heating, and all the time especially during a power outage.</li>
				<li>Get Winter Gear. Coats, Jackets, Boots, Long Socks, Sweaters (even the ugly kind), Gloves, Hats, and Scarfs (or Masks) can make the cold much more bearable. Make sure you wear good gloves designed for Winter. Any glove is better than no glove, but one time I wore garden gloves instead of winter gloves outside, and my hands nearly got frostbite twice. Make sure you get backups for each Winter clothing item, if affordable.</li>
				<li>Check the Weather Reports. Know the weather before going out, to prepare for complications on the road. Try to know the weather about one week in advance, even if you don't plan on going out. One good website for checking the weather is: <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/">"Local, National, & Global Daily Weather Forecast - AccuWeather"</a> (1). If Internet is unavailable, consider getting a radio, or even a local newspaper.</li>
				<li>Don't Get any Clothing Wet Outside. Not only will the wetness make you cold in that body part, but it also tends to smell like a wet dog.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>That's obvious, or at least it should be. For some people/communities, winter storms catch them by surprise, and they don't have the appropriate supplies to stay inside. Early preparation is best, like storing water and stockpiling dry, nonperishable food. However, if supplies are low and you can get more before or during the storm, these tips can help:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Buy Non-perishable Food Items. Dryed, canned, or otherwise preserved food can last for a long time, years in some cases, and help in surviving crisises. Try to keep at least 3 days worth of food for you, your family, and/or household members. You might have some left over for friends, family, and neighboors who need it. Avoid frozen food if possible, because they can spoil fast when the power is down. If you have frozen food already in a power outage, then try preserving it by packing snow (as clean as possible) into bags, and putting them in the fridge/freezer.</li>
				<li>Store Water. Have water available in case the pipes freeze, burst, or the town water supply is limited. I suggest you buy some barrels that can store about 30 gallons each. Perhaps you can buy 30-gallon barrels for all household members, and fill one half-way with tap water, day-by-day, until all barrels are filled. This practice is best for <em>preparing for</em> Winter storms to strike. <em>In</em> Winter storms/Power outages however, you should save as much water as possible, in whatever's available, before water becomes unavailable.</li>
				<li>Find a Good Food/Water Storage Place. Preferably dry places unlikely to get damaged/compromised from flood water, burst pipes, power outages, and other snow storm damage.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Sure, food and water are important, but having ways to pass time and maintain sanity are important too, especially with children. Without TV, video games, internet, or other electrical devices, other entertainment forms/things to do must be found. Sometimes, the best way forward is going back, meaning that you could do things people used to do before electricity. Some of my suggestions are:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Tell Stories. They can be true, personal, old fables, made-up, or even based on shows/movies/video games/novels. I remember telling my little brother a story from an open-ended RPG called "Geneforge", and it helped us get through a Michigan power outage.</li>
				<li>Read Books. Chances are, you've got books lying around that you've forgotten about. Try to find any novel that could be interesting, even if you've read it before. You can read it to yourself, or others if available. Even if the book/reading material isn't as interesting now, any entertainment is better than none.</li>
				<li>Play Board Games. If you have them, use them! They're not only good entertainment for yourself and others, but they're also great family bonding opportunities. If you don't have them, buy some if possible, or even make some up yourself.</li> 
				<li>Make-Up Games. You can play charades, "Try not to Laugh" a game where people try to make other people laugh, "Would you Rather" a game from the Nickelodeon TV Show "Zoey 101", and any other kind of game you can think of.</li>
				<li>Find Hobbies. One of my hobbies in the COVID-19 Quarantine is making "Solar Ovens" out of cardboard boxes. You can also try DIY science experiments, building a house of cards, drawing, whistling, singing (hopefully not too loudly), writing a journal about surviving the storm or other experiences, writing made-up stories, making artwork, and anything else you can think of.</li>
				<li>Use a Battery-powered Radio. They can be great sources of entertanment and knowledge. More will be explained later.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>In a power outage, alternate power supplies may be needed. Sure, you may have AA and AAA batteries in the closet, but sometimes they're not enough. Be sure to stock-up on multiple kinds of batteries if possible, and you may want to buy a generator* if you have the money. Here are some tips on stockpiling/using batteries and generators: </p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>Try to buy extension cords, converters, and transformers to help transfer power from batteries/generators to appliances, and keep generators outside.</li>
				<li>Buy appliances that use certain kinds of batteries for emergencies, like special fridges that run on car battery.</li>
				<li>Do your homework on a certain battery kinds/brands before buying it. Look up the battery type, the company that makes it, and any product reviews available. <em>My father once bought some batteries, but they ran out of juice fast</em>.</li>
				<li>Solar-powered batteries can harrnes some of the sun's energy for your own use. That power may be limited, but its better than nothing in a power outage.</li>
			</ol>
		
			<p>*Word of warning though, generators can generate harmful gases, which can be dangerous indoors. If they must be inside, make sure they're in separate rooms with plently of ventilation, and extension wires.</p>

			<p>More than food, water or power, warmth is needed in a Winter storms. I still remember stories about people freezing alive in winter storms, since the human body can only handle certain temperatures for so long. Some tips to keep warm in a power outage are:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Put Blankets on the Bed. They conserve body heat while sleeping, and you can wrap them around your body to keep warm while awake at night. Get 2 for each bed, to have back-ups when necessary.</li>
				<li>Use Battery-powered Heaters. If affordable, they provide heat to rooms, yourself and others in the house too.</li>
				<li>Drink Warm Fluids. Whether it's soup, Hot Coco, or even drinking warm water, warm fluids can help keep body temperature (and the mind) stable in the middle of Winter.</li>
				<li>Wear Warm Clothes. There are resources online on what to wear/buy in Winter, at home and outside. Even if the clothes aren't fashionable, wearing them is better than turning into a life-sized ice sculpture.</li>
				<li>Huddle Together for Warmth. It's a timeless cold weather survival technique. If you don't like your family/household members for any reason though, you can try one of the other tips above.</li>
			</ol>

		<h2 ID="radio">Radio</h2>

			<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/41/7f/16/417f1607e84f3b2ff5f4128fb1f0d80b--ham-let-amateur-radio.jpg?b=t" alt="417f1607e84f3b2ff5f4128fb1f0d80b--ham-let-amateur-radio.jpg?b=t" Width="200">
			
			<p>Radios are a very useful tool in a crisis. Without TV or internet, Battery-powered radios could be your only contact with the outside world. They can give weather updates/forcasts about the storm. They can be an excellent entertainment/information source,  like "Gilligan's Isle". They can help you get needed help for yourself/loved ones. Here are some radio tips:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Get Rechargeable or Battery-powered Radios. They don't need electricity, so you don't have to be out of entertainment/information, or rack up thousands of dollars in energy bills in one day.</li>
				<li>Consider Getting a Weather Radio. They can give up-to-date Weather information, like what my family has.</li>
				<li>Learn The Available Radio Frequencies. Like TV, knowing the radio frequencies can help in finding useful information fast. For example, you can find the state of your local town's food and water supply, the risks of certain disasters, and how road travel is.</li>
				<li>Consider a Hand-crank Radio. They don't need electricity or batteries, just elbow grease. I recommend small, portable ones, to keep your arms from getting too tired.</li>
				<li>If Possible, Consider Making your own Radio. A radio basically sends and/or recieves electromagnetic signals and translates them into language. There are several kinds of DIY radios made of household items that you can look up.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>For more information on radios, which ones to buy, how to use/make them, and which frequencies to tune in to, I recommend doing your homework on radios and your local frequencies. To start, try going here: <a href="https://cozybeat.com/types-of-radio/#:~:text=Types%20of%20Radio%201%20One%20Way%20Radio.%20A,...%2010%20Ham%20Radio.%20...%20More%20items...%20">"34 Different Types of Radio – An Epic Complete Guide (Updated)"</a> (14), along with: <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lot/nwr_programming">"Need Help Programming Your Weather Radio"</a> (15), also: <a href="https://urbansurvivalsite.com/cb-radio/">"HOW TO USE A CB RADIO FOR SHTF"</a> (16).</p>
			
			<p>Finally, for those interested in making their own radio, try looking for blueprints like this: <a href="https://youtu.be/G8nxDnmhFr8">"How To Build A DIY Kids Working FM Radio: Elenco Snap Circuit Pro Project"</a> (17). I chose this video because my family has their own "Elenco Snap Circuit Pro" kit, but there are other blueprints online. I wanted to show you guys that if a kid can build a radio, anyone can.</p>

			<p>If you read any of the sections above, you would know that early preparation and survival plans are best for surviving a Winter storm/power outage crisis. However, have you realized that there were ways to survive Winter storms before electricity was discovered? Countries and cultures throughout the planet had special survival methods, which a lot of people have forgotten today. From storytelling to relieve boredom, to eating certain foods to maintain energy and warmth, people had wise ways to weather storms in the era before electricity. To help you look for old-timey ways to overcome storms, try starting your search here: <a href="https://blogs.ancestry.com/cm/how-did-people-survive-the-winter-years-ago/">"How Did People Survive the Winter Hundreds of Years Ago?"</a> (18), and here: <a href="https://www.offthegridnews.com/lost-ways-found/forgotten-skills-that-helped-the-native-americans-survive-winter/">"Forgotten Skills That Helped The Native Americans Survive Winter"</a> (19). The "Old School" method can be excellent in a time of crisis.</p>

			<p>To sum it all up, "The Great American Winter Storm of February 2021" reminded Americans from coast-to-coast about the terrifying power of nature, and the importance of preparing to survive disaster. There were things my family did to survive past storms/power outages physically and mentally, but now I know we could have done other things. </p> 
			
			<p>1st, we could have dressed for winter weather. I was sweating from the inside out with layers, which wouldn't have happened if I had done my homework about dressing. 2nd, we needed a good stockpile of food and water. We had some food in the fridge and pantry, but cooking it wasn't easy, and neither was getting water. 3rd, Entertainment. my family kept entertained with books and storytelling based off videogames, but now I know more entertainment options that didn't involve electricity. 4th, batteries. There are much more kinds of batteries in the world than Duracell's AA and AAA models, including DIY varieties. Not all of them would have been great for power, but they're better than nothing, and making the DIYs would have been a great way to pass the time. 5th, again, staying warm involves more than pilling on layers and staying indoors. Today, I also drink warm water to handle the cold. Drinking unheated water in the middle of winter will freeze you from the inside out. 6th, radios. In the show "Gilligan's Isle", the radio was a vital source of entertainment and information. My family had one during blackouts, but there are different kinds of radios for different kinds of crisises to consider. Finally, humans have survived Winter storms ages before we used electricity. Perhaps we need to remember those skills, or keep them handy just in case.</p>
			
			<p>I hope you guys use some of the tips in this article, its links, and your own research to survive, and help others survive another winter storm/power outage. If you guys have any more suggestions about surviving Winter storms/power outages please let the rest of us know in the comment section below (coming soon).</p>
