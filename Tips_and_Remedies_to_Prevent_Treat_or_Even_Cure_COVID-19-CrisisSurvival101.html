		<p>We have a problem. I shouldn't have to say it, but I will anyway: the COVID-19 invasion. Recently, the news stated that there are new more easily spread and dangerous strains of COVID-19 coming up (1). If the virus is adapting, then we need to adapt too. Sometimes new treatments are the answer, and other times, "You gotta back up to go forward" (2). I will offer some tips on beefing-up your own anti-COVID-19 defences. First however, let me share how me and my family have stayed safe so far from COVID-19.</p>

		<p>I come from a family with scientific/medical backgrounds. My dad heard about Neem trees by watching YouTube videos in summer 2020, with their medical and anti-viral effects. He had those trees as a child back in Ghana, and the YouTube video reminded him of it. He wanted us to make Neem tree leaves into a tea to boost our immune systems and fight COVID-19. He bought two Neem tree plants over the summer, and they have been producing great leaves for us, up to today. My mother also learned about the health and antioxidant properties of Garlic, Pineapple peels, Ginger, Lemon and Lime. She made a tea out of those 5 ingredents, and later added Neem tree leaves. This is the recipe:</p>

		<p>Ingredients for the Tea</p>		
		
		<ol> 
			<li>Ginger-1/4 cup chopped</li>
			<li>Pineapple Peels, Fruit and the top of one Pineapple (Add more of the peels than the inside fruit. don't forget to cut the top part of the pineapple and add it to the ingredents.)</li>
			<li>Garlic - 3 cloves</li>
			<li>Lemon - 3 lemons</li>
			<li>Lime - 3 limes</li>
			<li>4-6 Neem tree leafs (optional)</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Wash and cut the ingredients and place in large, preferably stainless steel pot. Add 7 cups of water.</p>
		
		<p>Boil for 20 minutes, or for your desired time.</p>
		
		<p>Let it cool and pour in glass/plastic pitcher and store in refrigerator.</p>
		
		<p>Solid ingredents can be stored in the freezer and used again, but each successive time reduces the concentration and effectiveness of the tea.</p>
		
		<p>You can drink it any time during the day.</p>
		
		<p>Please heat it first before drinking. You can drink it cold as well but heating it is encouraged.</p>
		
		<p>The tea may be the most bitter, sour drink you ever put in your mouth, but the health benefits are worth it.</p>
		
		<p>This recipe has definitely helped us in the fight against COVID-19, but there were other things that we did, and other things you can do too.</p>

			<p>The video my dad found on YouTube was about the nutritional, medicinal, and antiviral aspects of Neem trees. I don't remember the exact name of the video, but I encourage you to do your own research on Neem trees and their health benefits. This can be a good place to start: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fPEY2Y3RCE">"Top 10 Health Benefits of Neem - Amazing Benefits of Neem Tree"</a> (3), and this too: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ9F0A7GdIo">"Benefits of Neem tree - boost immune system"</a> (4).</p>

			<p>I realize that with today's economy, any food is better than no food. However, if you can, eating foods with anti-inflammatory and immune system-boosting properties can go a long way in the fight against COVID-19. When I was in college, one of my professors stressed the importance of watching what we eat to maintain good health, and prevent illness. Some foods that I eat are oatmeal, carrots, oranges, bananas, apples, flax seed, green beans, and corn, in various recipes. However, I don't want you to just take my word for it, I want you to look up the benefits of certain foods against COVID-19. Try starting here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQrY2v5B4gw">"Foods to Boost your Immune System against COVID-19"</a> (5), and this too: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHRWWUrukwg">"16 Foods You Should Eat During COVID-19 That Will Boost Your Immune System"</a> (6). Some people can't eat certain foods for medical and non-medical reasons though. I suggest you do your homework, know your allergies, and perhaps talk to medical experts/dieticians before trying any kind of new food to eat in this pandemic.</p>
			
			<p>Here's a website that can help with eating healthy: <a href="https://hilltoptimes.com/2017/03/09/supertrack-nutrition-usda-app-for-fitness/">"SUPERTRACK NUTRITION USDA APP FOR FITNESS"</a> (7). It talks about the USDA SuperTracker Nutrition App. I used it myself as part of a nutrition course in college, and I think its tips helped me to stay healthy in this pandemic. It also helps with exercise too.</p>
			
			<h3 ID="exercise">Exercise</h3>

			<p>I cannot overstress the importance of exercise in this pandemic. Just as soliders train for war, we must train our bodies, and our immune systems to fight off COVID-19. I have personally gone on an exercise plan to get my blood pumping, get nutrients to my cells, and improve my blood circulation, for my immune system to find and attack disease. I do a combination of Stretching, Aerobic, and Strength-training exercise-as learned from nutrition class. I started off small at the beginning of last year, then gradually increased my routine.</p>
			
			<p>Now, this is my daily routine while I'm at home. I try to do this twice a day, every morning and afternoon, for energy, to feel good, and to do hard work around the house without exhausting myself.</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>2 head turns left and right</li>
				<li>2 head nods up and down</li>
				<li>2 head bends side to side</li>
				<li>2 hip turns with hands on my hips</li>
				<li>2 hip turns with arms out to the side (after stretching the arms)</li>
				<li>2 hip turns with hands behind my head</li>
				<li>2 pairs of shoulder rolls with forearms extended forward, front and back</li>
				<li>2 pairs of windmills, front and back</li>
				<li>2 head-shoulders-knees-toes, from top to bottom</li>
				<li>Touching my toes 8 times, and rising up with arms extended to the sky after the fourth time, and the eighth time</li>
				<li>Walking while kicking my butt 4 times on each leg</li>
				<li>Walking while lifting my legs to my chin 4 times on each leg</li>
				<li>Doing 2 leg lunges on each leg, then holding each leg lunge in place for 5 seconds, then switching to the other leg, for a total of two times on each leg</li>
				<li>Walking to my backyard and doing 10 jumping jacks, then breathing in and out twice, then taking a deep breath</li>
				<li>Running around the perimeter of my backyard 3 times in one direction, while jumping over intentionally-placed tumbleweeds</li>
				<li>Walking around the perimeter of my backyard 3 times in the other direction, walking around the tumbleweeds</li>
				<li>Putting on a heavy backpack and doing 10 push-ups</li>
				<li>Putting the heavy backpack on my feet and doing 10 sit-ups</li>
				<li>Finally, putting the heavy backpack on my back and doing 10 pull-ups on a nearby table or guardrail.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>I realize that some of the exercises here are a little intense, and even I don't do this routine every day. This is just an example of how I planned my routine to help you plan yours. Word of warning though, if you overdo your daily exercise, you could weaken your immune system. For help planning your routine, try this site first, <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/406513-what-are-some-different-types-of-exercise/">"Time to Change Up Your Routine?: The 3 Main Categories of Exercise"</a> (8).</p>

			<p>All the major health experts are saying: "Get tested for COVID-19 to help stop the pandemic!" However, even if everyone in America can be tested in one day, I doubt that will completely protect people from the virus. I am not against testing for COVID-19, I just want people to know why they shouldn't pin all their hopes on testing. People who tested negative today could be infected tomorrow. Plus, there are multiple types of COVID-19 tests, and the faster they are, the less accurate they are. Even the most accurate test could take days to weeks, and it might not be 100% accurate. During that time, the testee could have had COVID-19 and recovered, or have been asymptomatic, and he or she didn't even know it. With new strains of COVID-19, more extensive testing may be called for, which would take a lot of time and resources. My advise is to only get tested if you truely feel a need to, like if you display symptoms, have been to a public event, or travel. I find that staying home and healthy as much as possible would be better then constant testing if you feel well, at least until fast, accurate testing methods have been developed. However, testing is ultimately your decision. You should look up new updates of the symptoms of COVID-19 and its variants to watch out for, and new updates in testing methods. To start you off, try going here: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/index.html">"CDC: COVID-19 Testing"</a> (10), and here: <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/blog/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-updates-methods-cost-availability/">"The Latest in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Testing Methods and Availability"</a> (11).</p>

			<p>Throughout 2020, the main treatment for COVID-19 was drugs like Remdesivir (Veklury), Dexamethasone, Convalescent plasma, and Monoclonal antibodies (MABs). People infected with COVID-19 at any stage should look up these drug treatments, and talk to doctors to see what treatments are best for them.

			<p>The Pineapple tea and the Neem tree leaf tea were both natural remedies from my parent's homeland of Ghana, with a lot of health benefits. I also had a microbiology professor that stressed the importance of natural remedies from cultures around the world to treat disease. The natural chemicals probably have much less side-effects than the artifically-made drugs that Big-Pharma produces, and some of them have lower price tags too. However, some people can't use certain natural remedies, for various reasons. I also understand that the remedies are generally not as tested as other "over-the-counter" or FDA-Approved drugs/treatments. They might not work, or work as desired, and they may even be dangerous in some cases. I encourage you to do your own research on natural remedies in America and abroad (especially places that had viruses similar to COVID-19 before) to find treatments that are likely to work, and work safely. Talking to a medical expert is also encouraged.

			<p>People are willing to try almost anything to overcome this virus, especially infected hospital patients. There are plenty of clinical trials in America and abroad, for drugs to prevent/treat COVID-19. These trials are for healthy people, outpatients, and inpatients. I recommend doing your homework on the latest treatments/clinical trials for treating COVID-19. They can re-assure you about progress in fighting the virus. If you are considering entering a clinical trial yourself, then especially do your homework on the drug, how it works, and exactly what the researchers want you to do. For help, try starting here: <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/experimental-covid-19-treatment-aimed-at-keeping-ventura-county-residents-out-of-hospitals/ar-BB1drTG1">"Experimental COVID-19 Treatment Aimed at Keeping Ventura County residents out of hospitals"</a> (15), and this too: <a href="https://covid.idea.medicine.uw.edu/page/treatment/clinical-trials">"U.S. Clinical Trials for COVID-19 Treatment"</a> (16).</p>
		
			<h3 ID="vaccines">Vaccines</h3>

				<img src="https://i.redd.it/m62q5zl1ylr41.jpg" alt="m62q5zl1ylr41.jpg" Width="200">
		
			<p>The last treatment stated here is vaccines. They may be the answer in fighting this pandemic, but there is much heated debate about them. Aside from their scarceness in America, there is also heated debate on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. Some people are skeptical of vaccines made and approved in a few months, when they usually take a year or two to make. Some people are skeptial of new vaccine-making methods, which replaces partial/weakened viral particles with mRNA. Others are conserned about possible side effects from the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. However, clinical trials have proven so far the effectiveness of both vaccines to prevent COVID-19. I strongly advise you to do your homework thorughly before even considering taking any vaccine, from the USA and abroad. Even local, state, and federal governments are not 100% sure that the vaccines will make people immune to COVID-19, or keep them from spreading the virus. To start your research off, please go here: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/12/21/covid-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-moderna-everything-know-them/3955331001/">"Two COVID-19 vaccines are now authorized in the US; here's what we know about them"</a> (17), also: <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/07/here-are-all-the-companies-working-on-covid-19-vac.aspx">"Here Are All the Companies Working on COVID-19 Vaccines, Treatments, and Testing"</a> (18), plus: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html">"Information about the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine"</a> (19), along with: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html">"Information about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine"</a> (20).</p>

		<p>Hopefully you realize how to do your homework on COVID-19, and why the emergence of new viral strains are not the end of the world. There are things that me and my family do every day to stay virus-free for over 10 months, and I think they can work for you too. Diet, exercise, and good hygiene are what we should do to stay healthy anyway, and COVID-19 has only increased its importance. Testing should only be done if there is a perceved need to test, since they're not always accurate and may take weeks to obtain results. I prefer healthy choices and natural remedies like Pineapple tea and Neem tree leaf tea. However, there are drugs today for treating/preventing COVID-19, like Remdesivir, Convalescent Plasma, and Monoclonal Antibodies. There are also experimental treatments and clinical trials for COVID-19 that can be tried for any disease stage, or for non-infected people. Vaccines seem to be the ultimate weapon in the war against COVID-19. Right now though, few are available, they were tested less than usual, they use relatively new technology, and they may have unplesant side effects, with a few rare cases being deadly or severe. Bottom-line: keep doing your homework about COVID-19 treatments, remedies, and prevention methods to protect yourself, your loved ones, your community, and your nation from COVID-19 and all of its varients. The greatest weapon we have in the war on COVID-19 is knowledge. If you guys have any tips on COVID-19 prevention, treatment, and remedies, please let the rest of us know in the comments section below (coming soon).</p>
