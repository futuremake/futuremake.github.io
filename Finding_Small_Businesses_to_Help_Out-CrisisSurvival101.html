			<p>Why talk about Small business today? Big business usually dominates the news, and it's still dominating today. Unless Small businesses are owned, patronized, or worked for, individuals don't think about them much. Now however, the news is noticing them more. It turns out about 1/2 of Americans work for/own Small businesses, and they keep money in local economies. For more information, please go to places like: <a href="https://99firms.com/blog/small-business-statistics/">"39 Surprising Small Business Stats for Success in 2021"</a> (1). The pandemic however forced many of them to have shorter hours, restrict services, and temporarily or even permanently go out of business. The problem is magnified when people voluntarily stop going to them to prevent COVID-19 spread, and go to major coorporations instead. Small businesses must adapt to help themselves and their local economies to survive. This post is about how business owners and consumers can help Small businesses <em>stay in business</em>.</p>

			<p>My family often shops at a local African market called: "Top F African Store & Fashions", in El Paso, TX. It sells traditional clothing from African cultures, but it also sells grocery items from American and African cultures. It's where my family gets our Yam and Plantain from, along with several types of meat and fish. It's a piece of our heritage in town, and an anchor in the raging storm of the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>

			<p>Big business may have advertisements, reputation, good product designs, and good hygeine to stop COVID-19 spread. However, Small businesses are more relatable. They understand the community better, and feel their needs more. They keep money in local economies, and people can get their goods/services closer. Finally, they embody the American Dream of opportunity, hard work, properity ownership, and living how you want-within reason-independently. That's why people should help Small businesses today, even if they haven't worked for, owned, or patronized one before. Now more than ever, they need our help.

Some common methods of helping Small businesses are listed below.</p>

			<p>The Internet is very popular, and COVID-19 has only made it more so. It's one reason why Big business is successful: They advertise their products online. Small businesses could do the same by making business websites, and sharing them with their community. However, website making isn't easy, even with non-coding methods. This website certainly wasn't easy. Small businesses could hire website designers-perhaps college students or recent college graduates in town-for help. They could also make websites themselves using blog hosts, like BlueStacks or WordPress (4). Advertising's future is the web, and Small businesses must catch up, or fall behind. For more reasons why, try going here: <a href="https://www.hikebranding.com/9-reasons-why-a-small-business-should-have-a-website/#:~:text=%20Why%20your%20Small%20Business%20needs%20a%20website,Market%20is%20very%20wide.%20With%20a...%20More%20">"9 Reasons Why a Small Business Should Have a Website?"</a> (5), and here: <a href="https://blogs.constantcontact.com/small-business-website/#:~:text=%2010%20Reasons%20Why%20It%E2%80%99s%20Important%20to%20Build,true%20that%20you%20cannot%20control%20what...%20More%20">"10 Reasons Why Itâ€™s Important to Build a Small Business Website"</a> (6). To learn about making websites from scratch, I personally recommend <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">"KhanAcademy's Computer Programming 'introduction to HTML/CSS' Course"</a> (7). That's where I learned how to make this website. Services like BlueStacks and WordPress help in designing websites without coding-for a price. Other non-coding website set-up methods can be found here: <a href="https://optinmonster.com/best-website-builders-for-small-business-compared-pros-and-cons/">"9 Best Website Builders For Small Business Compared (Pros and Cons)"</a> (8).</p>
		
		<h2 ID="delivery">Delievery</h2>

			<p>Ah, the classic delievery method. Common examples are the drive-through, pizza delievery, mail, phone, and online. Even medical doctors make house calls sometimes. Social distancing and other COVID-19 prevention methods have expanded delievery, especially by phone/online. The less people go out, the less likely they get COVID-19 after all. Small Business do deliveries by:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Taking phone/online orders from customers, and having things ready when they get to the place.</li>
				<li>Taking phone/online orders from customers, driving to their address and putting the product at their doorstep.</li>
				<li>Taking phone/online orders and doing services at the customer's address.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Of course, any business method must follow COVID-19 regulations, including mask-wearing, social distancing, and sanitization. Big business does it best with money and manpower, but Small business can do it too. Delieveries are good for goods/services, and web/phone calls are good for services like advice, and mail orders. Small business should also let clients know their COVID-19 policies. For tips on sanitizing, if needed, please go to: <a href="https://universe.byu.edu/2020/03/26/small-businesses-adapt-innovate-in-wake-of-covid-19-restrictions/">"Small businesses adapt, innovate in wake of COVID-19 restrictions"</a> (11), and here: <a href="https://huntnewsnu.com/64506/lifestyle/boston-small-businesses-adapt-to-covid-19-restrictions-prepare-for-the-holidays/">"Boston small businesses adapt to COVID-19 restrictions, prepare for the holidays"</a> (12).</p>

			<p>Before helping out Small businesses, they must be found first. In my town, there are multiple Small businesses that I've never heard of before, though I've lived there for years. Then I looked up El Paso's businesses, and found websites like <a href="https://www.epstrong.org/tookthepledge.php">"City of El Paso Business Pledge Companies-El Paso Strong"</a> (13), and <a href="https://www.yellowpages.com/el-paso-tx">"The Real Yellow Pages(R)-El Paso, TX Directory-YP.com"</a> (14). I found businesses like "Melissa Robinson", "A&S Contractors Inc"., "Fiveset Net Sports LLC", "Los II Brothers Burgers", and "Jerry's Automotive Services". Depending on your town's size, time and effort may be needed to find them all, but friends and family (perhaps one person finds businesses starting with "A" and another person finds businesses starting with "B") can help too. Know the business type you want to look up, and research the business throughly before you consider using their goods/services. I encourage you to research yourself what Small businesses there are in/around your town, and list those you want to visit or help.</p>

			<p>What I'm trying to say is, Small businesses need the help and business of the local population now more than ever, and people can benefit from going to them. Using Small Businesses' goods/services can help to revive/keep afloat the national economy, at the local level. Small businesses can adapt to this pandemic by changing their business model. People can help local businesses by using their services, and helping them change with the times. If you guys have any more tips on supporting Small Businesses, please let the rest of us know in the comments section below (coming soon).</p>
