        <h2>Basic Info</h2>
        
		<p><em>Hydrogen Peroxide</em> (H2O2). This small molecule, nearly twice the size of a water molecule, can be a great survival tool.</p>
		
		<p>I found out about its power after looking up ways to improve my backyard potted food garden last year. I searched on YouTube, and found this video from "Daisy Creek Farms with Jag Singh" about how H2O2 can be used in diluted amounts in the home garden (1). I personally used it to: 
		<ol> 
			<li>Get more oxygen gas (O2) into the plants,</li>
			
			<li>Kill off mold spores on the underleaves (it certanly cleared the mold spores from under my Okra plants),</li>
			
			<li>Scatter the Whiteflies that sucked the undersides of the leaves and stems, which prevented the plants from growing for weeks, and</li> 
			
			<li>Kill off the mushrooms that gre in the pots (I don't know if the fungi was beneficial or not, but it started to grow after the plants stopped growing in the mid-fall, so perhaps it's good that the mushrooms were gone).</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>The "Daisy Creek Farms" video also details how to use H202 in other ways, like for inoculating plant seeds to keep them from disease, disinfecting planting containers, and disinfecting potting soil for the plants.</p>
		
		<p>I found another video on YouTube from "Garden Tips" that talks about even more uses for Hydrogen peroxide in the garden (2). It can be used to revive dying plants by soaking their roots. It can also be used to help seeds to sprout, seedlings to grow, in disinfecting garden tools, and as a weed killer in high concentrations.</p>
		
		<p>However, people must be careful using H2O2 in the garden (3). It's environmentally friendly, decomposes into O2 and water, and it benefits plant growth when used in the right concentrations. However, it's also bad for the soil because it kills off good bacteria that the plants need as well as bad bacteria, and it can take a while for the good bacteria to regenerate.</p>
		
		<p>Aside from medicine and the garden, H2O2 can be a great cleaning agent (4). The YouTube video from "Clean My Space" describes how it can be used to clean toilets, get stains off clothes, clean kitchen counters, and more! However, I didn't use H2O2 myself in this way, so don't entirely take my word for it.</p>
		
		<p>Basically, that brown bottle in our bathrooms or medicine cabnets has more uses than just for wounds, and being able to use household items for more than one thing is a good survival trait. Like a mad genius named "Bumi" said in "Avatar: The Last Airbender": "Instead of seeing what they want you to see, you have to open your brain to the possibilities" (5). I hope that is what you guys do when looking at your household items (within reason).</p>
        
		<p>If you guys find any more uses for H2O2, please let the rest of us know in the comment section down below (comming soon).</p>
