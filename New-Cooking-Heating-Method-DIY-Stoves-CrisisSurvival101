        <h2>Basic Info</h2>
        
		<p>Imagine: all electricty/natural gas was gone in an instant. Either house foreclosure, natural disasters, not paying the gas/electric bill, or riots took it from you. How are you going to keep you and your family warm at night, or in the winter? How can you cook? One answer is a DIY stove, or a small travel stove. It's best to watch people make it and use it to learn about it, but using and making the stoves are not as easy as they make it look.</p>
		
		<p>I first heard about DIY stoves by watching a video my dad found about a year ago. That video taught people how to make a "Penny Can Stove" (1). It's basically made with soda (Aluminium) cans with holes at the top, filled with alcohol, and is turned "on" by igniting the vapors on the stove's side. Something should be put around the stove for cooking, and to prevent anything/anyone from getting burned. To turn the stove "off", simply cover the holes with the bottom of another can. This is the video: <a href="https://youtu.be/mGCq_0lfRLM">"How to Make a Penny Can Stove"</a> on YouTube. It's a very cool DIY stove idea.</p>
		
		<p>Recently, I found a video for another kind of DIY stove called a "Wood Gas Stove", for camping or when electricity and gas are unavailable (2). It uses all-natural fuel-or twigs and leaves from the ground-and it's lit using a match, lighter, or even the old "magnifying glass" trick. This is the video:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BxODae_BS74">"How to Make a Wood Gas Stove-Compact & Efficient!"</a> on YouTube. It's a good, cost-effective, environmentally-friendly way to heat up food on the go or in the woods, and it's also a good way to reuse a food can.</p>    
		
		<p>A simple "pot stand" was put in the IntenseAngler "Wood Gas Stove" video without the instructions for how to make it. Here are some links for making stove stands from <a href="https://youtu.be/x9xnOVyYF84">Powhatan42</a> (3), and <a href="https://youtu.be/jXN0n8YNpDc">IntenseAngler</a> (4), both on YouTube. Any other metal frame could work for a stove stand, as long as the stove fits inside, and it holds the item to be cooked/heated at a reasonable height from the stove.</p>
		
		<p>I also recently found a video about making a "Rocket Stove" from <a href="https://youtu.be/mi8zAslcSxc">Andrew W</a> on YouTube (5). A large can, 2 medium cans, and a small can are needed. The top of the large can is needed too. It's another great way to reuse a can, and cook without gas or electricity.</p>
		
		<p>There are many alcohol stove designs, but some are better than others, depending on the person using it, and the need for its use. It's best to do your homework, and see what kind of stove you want before you buy/make it. For some help, please see this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexDNx5LtdM">"Watch THIS Before You Buy an Alcohol Stove!:Alcohol Stove Battle - Testing 11 Different Stoves"</a> by PaleoHikerMD, on YouTube (6).</p>
		
		<p>If you like a wood stove more, then do your homework on the different kinds of wood stoves to make/buy too. For help, please watch this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/P28PK5m4Gjw">"The ULTIMATE Wood Stove Comparison - Watch THIS Before you Buy a Wood Stove!"</a> by PaleoHikerMD, on YouTube.</p>
		
		<p>Final Thoughts: DIY Stoves are very useful in crises, but they're more complex than they seem. The people on these videos make it look so easy, but seeing and doing are two <em>very</em> different things. There are fire, smoke, and gas risks to think about, and the kind of fuel to use can be very specific. I highly recommend doing your homework on using/making these stoves safely before doing it yourself, especially for beginners. I also recommend using them either outside, or indoors in a well-ventilated area, with minimum risk of burning yourself or anything/anyone else. If you guys find more or better uses/designs for DIY Stoves, or for heating/cooking in general, please let the rest of us know in the comment section down below (7).</p>
