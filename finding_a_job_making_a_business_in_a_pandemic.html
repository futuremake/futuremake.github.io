			<p>Today, restrictions were lifted across several American state. Businesses are reopening, masks mandates were recalled, and bigger gatherings are allowed. Hopefully people will be careful enough to make this last. Considering our countless bills, the more money we earn, the better. In this article, tips for both you and me about finding jobs in this pandemic will be shared, restrictions or no restrictions.</p>

			<p>When Quartenine orders started on March 31st, 2020, my parents' jobs were suspended, and so were my job application plans. My parents could do online work after a few months, and in november, they were allowed to go to work. I've been learning new skills until today, like coding and Spanish. I've also started hobbies like drawing and story-writting. Now, I'm back in the job market, but my job goals have changed from nearly a year ago.</p>
			
			<p>After Graduation, I wanted a "stepping-stone" job to help me start my career as a Biological Researcher, perhaps with an internship. However, the job application process has a lot to be considered. When my friend told me about not letting COVID-19 Domminate my life, because the Pandemic is improving and he even got his job back in February, I restarted my job hunt. for returning to the job market again after nearly a year of isolation, this article is for me and you. Lets take this journey together.</p>
			
		<h2 ID="experience_internships">Experience/Internships</h2>
			
			<img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bms.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Internship-Jokes-11.jpg" alt="Internship-Jokes-11.jpg" Width="200">
		
			<p>In the local news, I recently learned a "dirty little secret" about companies and jobs: they want degrees <em>and experience</em>. Companies want people with more experience in the career than you think. I thought I should focus on my college courses, and research jobs/get job experience later. However, one year after graduation, job finding is even harder. Whatever kind of job/career you want today, you should see what businesses in those careers are looking for, and how to get the skills/reliability they expect from employees. For example, a financial career can start as a casher in a local resturant. Future nurses could start out volunteering in a local hospital/clinic. The point is getting the experience necessary for your job/career choice.</p>
			
			<p>To help with finding job experience/internships/training, try going to places/websites in your local community that help with job-seeking first. For example, this place: <a href="https://borderplexjobs.com/what-we-do/job-seekers">"Solutions for Job Seekers"</a> (1). For more general information on getting job experience, try going here <a href="https://www.allaboutcareers.com/work-experience/how-to-/get-work-experience/">"How to Get Work Experience – Where should I start looking for work experience?"</a> (2), and here <a href="https://www.fastweb.com/career-planning/articles/the-4-ways-to-gain-job-experience">"4 Ways to Gain Job Experience"</a> (3). Finally, you can go to your old college's Career Center for help, either in person or online. For example, try going to a place like this: <a href="https://www.utep.edu/student-affairs/careers/">"University Career Center - Services Available Online"</a> (4).</p>
			
		<h2 ID="networking">Networking</h2>

			<p>Like the old saying goes: "Success is not about <em>what</em> you know, but <em>who</em> you know". Knowledge and skill are still important for jobs, but connections are often necessary too. Connections could be family, friends, coworkers, fellow volunteers, classmates, associates, bosses, and virtually anyone you know and trust. If they already work in the company, they can put in a good word for you. They can also help with resumes, practing interview questions, and more. Make a list of people you know that help in getting your "foot-in-the-door" for your job/career, and include their contact info. To help with making connections, try going here: <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-career-networking-tips-2062604">"The Importance of Career Networking"</a>(5) and here: <a href="https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/importance-of-networking-for-career-success">"Here's Why Networking is Important to Your Success"</a> (6).</p>
			
		<h2 ID="stepping_stone_jobs">Stepping-Stone Jobs</h2>
		
			<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a7/4b/44/a74b441a2118a9dde7bea05b8d9807d9.png" alt="a74b441a2118a9dde7bea05b8d9807d9.png" Width="200">
		
			<p>Many people take jobs as stepping-stones for other careers they <em>really</em> want. In my college, there was one student who worked in a Walmart Pharmacy. She used the job to pay off her tuition while studying for Pharmacy School. The "Stepping-Stone" job doesn't have to be directly career-related. There was another college student who wanted to go to medical school, but needed money now to pay for tuition and other expences. He works in a Gym, and as a Swim Coach. The jobs give him experience interacting with people, networking, and trying new ways to achieve goals and help others, all traits important for medical school, or any career. Make sure your "Stepping-Stone" job is a good fit, and teaches you things that support your career goals. For help finding stepping-stone jobs in your town, try using local job resources. Family, friends, and associates can help too. For additional help, try going to places like this: <a href="https://www.livecareer.com/resources/jobs/search/14-job-hunting-tips">"14 Quick Tips for Finding a New Job"</a> (7), and this: <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/how-to-find-the-best-jobs-for-you">"How to Find the Best Jobs for You"</a>(8).</p>
			
		<h2 ID="transportation">Transportation/Working Hours</h2>
		
			<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4a/c4/43/4ac443c5e9772a1ebd04e51981109a82.jpg" alt="4ac443c5e9772a1ebd04e51981109a82.jpg" Width="200">
		
			<p>Transportation and Working Hours, are important things to find in careers/job descriptions. Is the workplace just across the street, or on the other side of town? Should you drive, take the bus, bike, or walk to work everyday? Unless you're working from home, you should look up the workplace location, the traffic, and the days/hours you would work in a week. For additional help, try going to places like this: <a href="https://convene.com/catalyst/long-commute/">"How Long is Too Long to Commute?"</a>(9), and this: <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/commuting-to-work/">"Your Commute Is Bad for You, Here's How to Make It Better"</a> (10).</p>
			
		<h2 ID="top_jobs_to_get_today">Top Jobs to Get Today</h2>

			<img src="https://theviraler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/9-23.jpg" alt="9-23.jpg" Width="200">
		
			<p>I remember one piece of wisdom about getting jobs or starting businesses, "Find a need and fill it". This means find what jobs society needs the most, and train/apply for them. Here are some jobs/careers in high demand in America today: Computer Programming, Hospitality, Medicine, Engineering, etc. However, individual communities can have different job needs, that may change over time. What was needed in one town may be less needed in another. For inspiration on career goals, I recommend looking up the top careers needed now or in the future, at the National, State, and Local level. To help you search, start here: <a href="https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-best-jobs">"2021's 100 Best Jobs in America"</a> (11), and here too: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm">"Fastest Growing Occupations"</a> (12). </p>
			
		<h2 ID="local_communities">Local Communities</h2>

			<p>For a first job, many people would work where they live. It make sense, getting work experience without "Culture Shock", or having to move. I suggest doing your homework on places to work in your local community. Try going to this website as a start: <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/how-to-find-local-job-listings-2061852">"How to Find Local Job Listings"</a> (13), and this too: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZFMJqvjtKEo">"Best Way To Find Local Jobs"</a> (14).</p>

			<p>Some jobs/careers involve travel or moving across town, out of town, out of county, out of region, or across the country. Those jobs/careers must be really important, fulfulling, pay well, or otherwise be worth the move. Once, I heard a successful businesswoman say in an interview that sometimes, the path to success can get lonely, and may involve stepping outside of your comfort zone. However, with hard work, street smarts, good connections and a little luck, the businesswoman became successful in a new place. However, there are ways to make moving less stressful, and I encourage looking up the locations of certain out-of-town businesses you're interested in. Try going here: <a href="https://www.wayup.com/guide/get-job-another-city-state/">"How Do I Get a Job in Another City or State?"</a> (15), and here: <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-crosscountry-job-hunt-finding-a-job-in-a-different-city">"The Cross-Country Job Hunt: Finding a Job in a Different City"</a> (16).</p>
			
		<h2 ID="travel">Travel</h2>

			<p>I get it: The hassle of traveling can be daunting, especially to an entirely different climate in the United States. I've been there. My family has moved from Ghana, to Canada, to Michigan, to Texas, to the desert of Far West Texas. I wondered multiple times how I could handle it, but then I realized how adventurous it was, and the opportunities there were, especially with networking and touring towns. I'm not going to lie, moving will take some getting used-to, especially in the first month. However, with resilience, career determination, a desire for a better life, and some luck, it can certainly be done.</p>
			
			<p>Looking back though, we could have done a little research about some of the areas before actually moving. In Dallas, TX, house hunting was longer and harder than we thought. We lived in a Motel 6 room for several weeks before dad could find a job, and we could afford to rent a house in the Dallas/Fort-Worth County Area. Doing homework beforehand about jobs, locations, cost-of-living, ...etc., would have shortened and smoothed the move, and knowing the twin towns' attractions would have made it enjoyable. If I had known Dallas, TX had "Six Flags", an impressive "Texas State Fair", is a founding/leading center for Video Game development/Outer Space research, I would have been excited. Kids relunctant to move would be easier to deal with, having reasons to like the move. I encourage doing your own research on moving, and the places you are considering moving to.

			<p>Pay. It should go without saying. You may love what you do, but how can you do it without paying bills? When job-hunting, pay should not be the only/most important factor, but it's a signifiant one to consider. For help in finding jobs that pay living wages, try going here: <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries">"2021 Salaries of Jobs in US"</a> (19), and here too: <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/living-wage-3305771">"Living Wage and How It Compares to the Minimum Wage"</a> (20).</p>

			<p>If you have a job already, you may want a promotion sooner or later. If you've worked at a company/career for a while, especially one you really like, you may want a more important or higher-paying position. For beginners in the job market though, it may be more complicated than they think.</p> 
			
			<p>In the Networking Section, the importance of knowing people for success was discussed, and promotions are no exception. Bosses and Executives want trustworthy people in leadership/skilled positions, to benefit the company. When job-hunting, do your research on the company and getting promotions there, if you love the company like Spongbob Squarepants loves his fry cook job.

			<p>I know that most of this article's tips involved getting a job, not starting a business. However, most people are job-hunting today, and these tips can be useful for entrepreneurs too.</p>
			
			<p>First, get as much career experience as possible, perhaps as an company intern, which could also help in business making. Second, make, use, and keep a network of connections. They can help find career opportunities, and with setting up/drumming up business. Third, try "stepping-stone" jobs. They help with getting knowledge/experience with a new career or with starting a business. They're also a way to earn needed money. Fourth, Think about transportation/working hours. They're both important in jobs and business-making. Fifth, find the hotest jobs/careers at the National, State, and local level, to have a lasting job/business. Sixth, consider local job/business options, to avoid moving hassle for career goals. Seventh, before moving, do your homework about the place you plan to move to. Eighth, in careers that require moving, plan your move early and well. Ninth, look up how well a job/business is likely to pay, and see if that's a living wage. Tenth, find ways to get promoted, or grow your business, if you really like your career.</p>
			
			<p>Like I said before, I am <em>not an expert</em> on these things, I'm just trying to find answers, like you. There is more to job-finding/business-making than what this article says, and hopefully you spend time finding out for yourselves. Lets get back to work together. If you guys have any more suggestions, please let the rest of us know in the comment section below (comming soon).</p>
