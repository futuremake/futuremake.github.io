		<p>Ah, Spring. The days are getting longer, the grass is beginning to grow, Butterflies fly over our heads, and it's time to plant (or replant) a Food Garden!</p>
		
		<p>Food gardens have many benefits, especially in a pandemic, with people staying home as much as possible. First, they provide food relatively quick and nearby. Second, you know exactly what's in the food, with no pesticides, growth hormones, or questionable fertilizers unless you add them. Third, Home-grown food is often healthier-and tastier-than store-bought food. Fourth, It's a great opportunity to go outside and get sunshine, fresh air, and exercise. Fifth, the whole family is educated about where food comes from, and how it's grown. Sixth, garden plants like "Neem Trees" or "Ginger" can be medicinal, and used to treat diseases (like Covid-19). Seventh, the food/medicinal plants and their produce can be shared between friends/neighboors/community members and at food banks, to keep the whole town from hunger and to prevent/treat disease like Covid-19. Finally, the plants/herbs/produce can be sold between friends/neighboors/community members to help make some much-needed cash in this struggling economy.</p>
		
		<p>However, it's much easier to talk/read about having a garden than actually doing it: I speak from personal experience. Last summer, I tried to grow 2 Neem Trees, Okra, Thai Basel (apparently, there is a difference between Thai and Sweet Basel), Black-Eyed Peas, Ginger, and Garlic. Long-story short, only some Thai basel, some Okra, the Neem Trees, and some Black-Eyed Pea plants survived until winter, but I did get a decent yield of Okra and Black-Eyed Pea pods, along with medicinal leaves from the Neem Trees. Plus, the Neem trees are alive today, inside the house. I was blessed to have parents with farming experience for help, but there were several things I could have done before planting. If you are considering food gardening, here are some helpful tips.</p>
		
		<h2 ID="my_personal_tips">My Personal Tips</h2>
		
		<img src="https://cdn.quotesgram.com/img/51/80/1467068177-024bed93072ff95151c484ddef7834f7.jpg" alt="1467068177-024bed93072ff95151c484ddef7834f7.jpg" width="200">
		
		<p>First, winter is the best time for garden planning, well in advance of local planting seasons. Look up the climate/growing zone of your local town, to see when to plant seeds/transplants.</p> 
		
		<p>Second, do your homework on plants you want to grow. Do you want Tomato, Blueberry, Beans, or Basel Plants? Find out the when/where/how of planting the seeds/seedlings, transplanting them, and taking care of them.</p>
		
		<p>Third, decide if you want the plants on the ground, or in pots. Personally, I prefer pots for plant mobility, but it's up to you. Either way, the soil must be prepared for the specific garden plant.</p>
		
		<p>Fourth, Choose a space for your plant, where they'll most likely thrive. That's why I like pots, because I can move my plants at anytime, without worrying about transplant shock.</p>
		
		<p>Fifth, water the soil around the plants, not the plants themselves. Plants get water from their roots, and watering the leaves/stems will only block the plant's leaves from oxygen, and cause fungal growth and infection. Overwatering can block the plants' roots from oxygen too.</p>
		
		<p>Sixth, pesticide. I used diluted Hydrogen Peroxide (H202) against the Whiteflies and mold under the Okra plants' leaves, and they worked amazingly. They also helped my Thai Basel and Black-Eyed Pea plants to grow. I sprayed them every morning and afternoon, and I occasionally used a slightly stronger solution of Hydrogen Peroxide on soil, to kill any bad bacteria/fungi keeping the plants from growing.</p> 
		
		<p>Homemade pesticides are generally more ecofriendly than store-bought, but be careful about them. Whenever you hear about one, do your homework about the ingredients and how it works on plants, then test it for about a month on one small part of one kind of plant to see how it works. I made the mistake of not researching or testing a pesticide properly last summer. I made a pesticide from a recipe I found online out of corn oil, dish soap, and hot water. I put it on a Black-Eyed Pea plant leaf, and an Okra plant leaf for a week. They seemed ok, and the Whiteflies stayed away from the leaves, so I poored the mixture all over all of them. However, I didn't realize that I did my tests on a relatively cool week, early in the summer. I also didn't realize that vegetable oil can get very hot in the sun. Later on, when it got hotter, the plants' leaves and stems began to fry like stir-fry. Only about a third of them survived. However, I don't regret the experience, because it taught me some hard, but useful lessons about not getting desperate when plants don't grow, about doing research before doing anything, and about appropriate/careful testing before trying anything, just like medicine and science.</p> 
		
		<p>Eighth, I want to stress the importance of fertilizer. I didn't know this at the time, but Okra plants lose their leaves on purpose in low-nutrient soil as they grow, to conserve resources. If I had known that, I wouldn't have desperately used the oil pesticide on all of them. I also realized that plants can't produce fruit, leaves, or other usable produce without the right kind of nutrients in the soil.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, I kept a journal of my gardening experience, for reference and review. I find that it's best to take short, quick, to-the point notes anything interesting happening, and what to do about it. Hopefully, you guys learn from my mistakes, and we can all become even better gardeners than I was.</p>

		<img src="https://glincaenglish.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/weather.jpg" alt="weather.jpg" width="200">
		
		<p>Look up your local growing/climate zone, to see what kind of plants can grow in your area. A good place to start is: <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/maps-for-growing-zones-from-the-usda-2132409#:~:text=USDA%20Plant%20Hardiness%20Zone%20Maps%20by%20Region%201,to%20be%20hot%20and%20humid.%20More%20items...%20">"Maps for Growing Zones From the USDA"</a> (1). For gardening outside the United States, try going to: <a href="https://davisla.wordpress.com/plant-zones/">"Plant Zones"</a> (2), and even, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Antarctica">"Climate of Antarctica"</a> (3).</p>

		<img src="https://www.jokejive.com/topic/plant+biology#&gid=1&pid=2" alt="plant+biology#&gid=1&pid=2" width="200">
		
		<p>You should look up the plant you want to grow, including space, sunlight, watering, fertilizer, pests/diseases, ...etc. A good place to start is your local state/state university's agriculture website, similar to this one: <a href="https://agrilifeextension.tamu.edu/solutions/easy-vegetables-to-grow/">"Easy Vegetables to Grow"</a> (4). YouTube videos and tips from anyone you know with gardening experience can help too.</p>

		<p>You should also do your homework on how much space your plant needs to survive, grow, and make produce, and especially look at pot size. You should also look up how much space to put between plants of the same species, because they could compete with each other for resources. When planting two plants of different species close together, look up what kinds of plants attack each other, and which plants can coexist. A good place to start is this: <a href="https://zacsgarden.com/how-to-start-a-garden/plant-spacing/">"Plant Spacing"</a> (5).</p>
		
		<h2 ID="preserving">Preserving</h2>

		<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fa/1c/f0/fa1cf096373ca6fdbf271038be57f5af.jpg" alt="fa1cf096373ca6fdbf271038be57f5af.jpg" width="200">
		
		<p>Sometimes, food gardens can provide more produce than immediately needed. However, your fridge may be full, and watery produce like fruit or young bean pods won't keep long in the fridge. There are other produce preservation methods like freezing, canning, making jam, drying, etc. You should look up which method would be best for your produce. For help, try going here: <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/keep-produce-fresh-longer">"Keep Produce Fresh Longer"</a> (6), or here: <a href="https://clark.com/shopping-retail/29-ways-keep-your-fresh-produce-fresher-longer/">"29 Ways Keep Your Fresh Produce Fresher Longer"</a> (7).</p>

		<p>It's ok to ask for help sometimes, especially if you're a beginner gardener. If you don't know anyone with gardening experience, try looking up local gardening clubs, or online gardening networks/websites in your local town, similar to this: <a href="https://txmg.org/elpaso/">"El Paso County Master Gardeners"</a> (8).</p>
		
		<h2 ID="donating_selling">Donating/Selling</h2>

		<p>One good use for extra crops/plants is to donate/sell them to others. Food pantries have a constant need for food to help people affected by the pandemic. Giving/sharing plants with others helps them start their own garden, or gives them something to brighten their day a little at home. Medicinal herbs could be very useful to stay healthy in this pandemic, and may help to prevent/treat COVID-19. Finally, selling plants/produce at local farmers markets, local resturants, or anyone willing to pay for them can earn you some extra money or food, which makes anyone happy in today's economy. Reaching out to friends, families, religious groups, local gardening groups and farmers markets can help, similar to this: <a href="https://txmg.org/elpaso/">"El Paso County Master Gardeners"</a>, and this: <a href="https://uppervalleymarket.com/">"Upper Valley Artist & Farmers Market"</a>. </p>

		<p>Like I said earlier, pesticides may be necessary to keep a garden healthy, but they can be very tricky, and dangerous. Do your research and check local/state/national laws before using any kind of pesticide on any plant at all, for any condition. You may also want to look up the plant's possible problems before you try anything. For help, try starting at places like this: <a href="https://texasagriculture.gov/RegulatoryPrograms/Pesticides/AgriculturalApplicators/PesticideClassifications.aspx">"Pesticide Classifications"</a>, and this: <a href="https://thegardeningdad.com/10-best-insecticides-for-your-vegetable-garden/#:~:text=Botanical%20insecticides%20are%20organic%20applications%20that%20are%20non-toxic,botanical%20insecticides%20are%20spinosad%2C%20pyrethrin%2C%20and%20neem%20oil.">"10 Best Insecticides for Your Vegetable Garden"</a>.</p>
		
		<p>NOTE: I personally tried a homemade oil-based pesticide, and it killed a lot of my plants over the summer. My personal recommendiation is to use diluted Hydrogen Peroxide solutions, and to do research on your plants and their pests/diseases. To help with using H202 solutions, please go to: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kG2s5wDOrQ">"5  Benefits of Hydrogen Peroxide on Plants and Garden"</a>, from "Daisy Creek Farms with Jag Singh", and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI4p5T9n6Rw">"HOW TO CORRECTLY USE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE IN YOUR GARDEN?"</a>, from "GARDEN TIPS", both on YouTube.</p>

		<p>To summarize, food gardening is a great way to get cheap, organic food and even plant-based medicine into your diet and possession, respectfully. It's also a great way to breathe fresh air outside in your own backyard, without having to wear masks. You can donate your produce to the less-fortunate, or sell/trade your food for some extra cash, or at least for other kinds of food. Of course, Gardening requires a lot of work, time, and there are multiple things that can go wrong-I speak from experience. However, with so many people out of work, and travel/transport struggling across America and abroad, I believe it's worth the effort to try and grow our own food. It improves the physical and mental health of ourselves and our local communities. If you guys have any more tips about growing a food garden, please share in the comments section below.</p>
